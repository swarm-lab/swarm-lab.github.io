title: Join the Swarm Lab

---

#### Postdoctoral researchers

There is no postdoctoral position currently opened at the Swarm Lab. Such positions are rare because grants large enough 
to support a postdoctoral researcher are also rare. If you want to join the Swarm Lab as a postdoctoral researcher, your 
best option is to apply for postdoctoral fellowships that are granted by public and private foundations (NSF, Fulbrigth, 
Fyssen, etc.). The members of the Swarm Lab will very happy to help you find and apply for postdoctoral fellowships for 
which you are eligible. If you are interested, please do not hesitate to contact us at 
[jobs@theswarmlab.com](mailto:jobs@theswarmlab.com) or using our [contact form](/#contact).

#### Graduate students

Our lab is multidisciplinary and we welcome applications for graduate students with a background in biology, physics, 
mathematics, computer science, social science, etc. Please feel free to send us an email with your CV at 
[jobs@theswarmlab.com](mailto:jobs@theswarmlab.com). Make sure to include a paragraph or two explaining why you are 
interested in joining our lab. Depending on your background, we will direct you to the most appropriate graduate program 
at NJIT and/or Rutgers-Newark (the SwarmLab is part of the NJIT/Rutgers-Newark Federated Department of Biology). 
We will also help you during the application process. Most graduate programs offer direct financial support to their 
students via teaching assistantships. The members of the SwarmLab will work with you to apply for external fellowships 
in order to supplement or replace the funding provided by the graduate school. If you have any question about joining the 
SwarmLab as a graduate student, please do not hesitate to contact us at 
[jobs@theswarmlab.com](mailto:jobs@theswarmlab.com) or using our [contact form](/#contact).

#### Undergraduate and Master students (NJIT and Rutgers University)

The SwarmLab has a very active and diverse research program. All scientific disciplines are welcome and we will consider 
all applications from undergraduate and master students from NJIT and Rutgers University (see Visitors section below for 
other universities). Undergraduate students are eligible to register for one of the “Research and Independent Study” 
biology courses at NJIT or Rutgers Newark in order to get credits while conducting research projects in our lab. When 
possible, the members of the SwarmLab will also help you find and apply for fellowships to support you while you work 
with us. If you are interested in joining us or have any question about joining the SwarmLab as an undergraduate, please 
do not hesitate to contact us at [jobs@theswarmlab.com](mailto:jobs@theswarmlab.com) or using our [contact form](/#contact).

#### Visitors (all levels)

We welcome visitors at all levels to collaborate on research projects or do internships with us. Funding to support 
visitors is scarce but we will happily help you apply for fellowships (if available) in order to support your stay with 
us. We will also help you find affordable transportation to and housing options in or around Newark. Since every visitor 
case is unique, please contact us at [jobs@theswarmlab.com](mailto:jobs@theswarmlab.com) or using our [contact form](/#contact), 
and we will discuss your project and do everything possible to make it happen.
